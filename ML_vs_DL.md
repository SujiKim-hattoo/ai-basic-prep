## What is Machine Learning? 머신러닝이란?
* A field of AI where programs **learn from data** to make predictions, without being explicitly programmed.
* Relies on algorithms to find patterns in data.

## Limitation of Machine Learning 머신러닝의 한계
* Requires **manual feature engineering**, where humans must select and transform the most relevant data features for the model to work effectively.

## What is Deep Learning (DL)? 딥러닝이란?
* A specialized subset of Machine Learning that uses multi-layered **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)**.
* **Automates feature extraction**, learning complex patterns directly from raw data like images or text.

## Comparison 비교
